## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
## to find out what you can put into this file. You can find this here:
##      $ info wget.info 'Startup File'
## Or online here:
##      <https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Startup-File>
##
## Wget initialization file can reside in `/usr/local/etc/wgetrc`
## (global, for all users) or `$HOME/.wgetrc` (for a single user).
##
## Global settings (useful for setting up in `/usr/local/etc/wgetrc`).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:

# You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http, https, and ftp.
# They will override the value in the environment.

#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

# If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
